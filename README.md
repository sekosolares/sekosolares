## 🙋🏻‍♂️ Welcome! Nice to see you here!

🦉 Hi there! I am Seko, and I’m a web developer with 4+ years of experience on frontend development. Proactive, creative and responsible.

I am a fast learner with a curious mind. I like to improve my knowledge and skills by taking courses, making projects and reading documentation. When it comes to teamwork, I like to make my part and see how everything fits together as a big solution. As a developer, my goal is to build solutions and have fun in the process.

I have also worked with databases such as Oracle and Postgres using PL/SQL to manage Database-side processes.
