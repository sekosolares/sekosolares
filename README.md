## 🙋🏻‍♂️ Welcome! Nice to see you here!

🦉 Hi there! I am Seko, and I’m a web developer with 4+ years of experience on frontend development.

My goal is to improve user experience by empathizing with their current and potential needs, building strong relationships amid user and system, through software experience design and my strong passion for technology.

I have also worked with databases such as Oracle and Postgres using PL/SQL to manage Database-side processes.


👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some project to help our planet become a bit cleaner and improve life quality.
